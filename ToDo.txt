To do:
1.Feature Map output
2.Performance metrics
3.Enhance the bounding box regression output. 
4.Using AdaBoost generate the pseudolabels with the help of results obtained from lrpm-ham and transformer attention model.

Finished:
1. Use unlabelled images as inpt and generate polyp region images (bounding box) using train_lrpm_ham.py
