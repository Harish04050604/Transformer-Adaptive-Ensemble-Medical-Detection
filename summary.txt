There are six stages in our project
Stage-1: Supervised Training on Labelled Data
    Input
        labelled/img
        labelled/ann

    What to Do
        Convert annotations to detection format (YOLO / COCO)
        Train two base models:
            LRPM-HAM (CNN-based) → strong local feature learner
            Transformer-Attention model → global context learner

    Output
        Two trained base detectors

     Purpose: Learn reliable initial polyp detection from limited labelled data.

Stage-2: Inference on Unlabelled Data
    Input
        unlabelled/img
        Trained base models

    What to Do
        Run both models on unlabelled images
        Obtain:
            Bounding boxes
            Confidence scores
        Store predictions separately for each model

     Purpose: Produce candidate detections for pseudolabeling.

Stage-3: Adaptive Ensemble with Al-AdaBoost
    Input
        Predictions from both models

    What to Do
        Combine predictions using Al-AdaBoost
        Assign higher weights to:
            Consistent detections
            High-confidence predictions
        Penalize:
            Conflicting or noisy detections

     Purpose: Reduce false positives and strengthen reliable predictions.

Stage-4: Pseudolabel Generation (Key Contribution)
    What to Do
        Apply confidence threshold (e.g., ≥ 0.8)
        Retain only high-confidence ensemble predictions
        Save them as pseudolabels for unlabelled images

    Purpose: Convert unlabelled images into weakly labelled data.

Stage-5: Semi-Supervised Retraining
    Input
        Original labelled data
        High-confidence pseudolabels

    What to Do
        Merge both datasets
        Retrain ensemble models
        Optionally iterate multiple rounds

    Purpose: Improve detection performance with minimal manual labeling.

Stage-6: False-Positive Reduction Analysis
    What to Evaluate
        False Positive Rate (FPR)
        Precision
        Recall
        mAP

    Comparision
        | Model                         | False Positives |
        | ----------------------------- | --------------- |
        | Baseline CNN                  | High            |
        | Proposed Ensemble             | Reduced         |
        | Transformer-Enhanced Ensemble | Lowest          |

    Purpose: Prove future enhancement effectiveness
